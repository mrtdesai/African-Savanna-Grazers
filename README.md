# African Savanna Grazers
Ecologists as part of the Serengeti Snapshot project use camera traps to study animal behvaior and get their locational data. This is increasingly important in the recent times especially for endagered species such as the Elephant - understanding their behavior and getting their locational data real-time can help protect and manage their species. 

This app was created to help ecologists quickly identify animal images taken from camera traps in the African Savanna. The app takes uploaded image(s) in .jpg format and classifies the image(s) using the VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which was fine-tuned and trained on images taken in the African Savanna. In the current version, the VGG-16 CNN has been trained for Elephant, Zebra and Wildebeest. The app can be seen at: www.africansavannagrazers.com

# Data
Images used to fine-tune the VGG-16 CNN were taken as part of Serengeti Snapshot Project: www.snapshotserengeti.org/beta/. Raw labelled data can be found at: https://datadryad.org//resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.5pt92 - image data has to scraped from the url indicated in this site.
