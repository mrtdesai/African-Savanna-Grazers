# African-Savanna-Grazers
This app was created to quickly identify animal images taken from camera traps in the African Savanna. The app takes uploaded image(s) in .jpg format and classifies the image(s) using the VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which was fine-tuned and trained on images taken in the African Savanna. In the current version, the VGG-16 CNN has been trained for Elephant, Zebra and Wildebeest.

Images used to fine-tune VGG16 CNN were taken as part of Serengeti Snapshot Project: www.snapshotserengeti.org/beta/
